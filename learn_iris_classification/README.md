- My second machine learning project, this time it is on a classic "classification" problem in ML and it is the "Iris Flower Classification" problem. I imported the dataset from Kaggle, did EDA, then created 2 models (SVM, and k-NN) to predict which particular group that an Iris flower would belong to given some attributes like sepal length/width and petal length/width.
- My main takeaway after doing this project is on the visual side of EDA through learning how to visualize and interpret data using seaborn. As there is a lengthy documentation section on heatmap, and pairplot. As opposed to just doing more simple EDA/imputing which I gained mostly from the Titanic survival prediction project.
- With these 2 basic projects done, the skills I gained would translate smoothly into my first major milestone machine learning project which is the California House Price prediction.
- I followed Modassir's guide on Medium, the link to the guide is listed here: https://medium.com/@mn.zamindar/iris-flower-classification-using-ml-29277b18b233
- The dataset which I used from Kaggle is listed here in the URL, and a csv file will also be provided in the folder as well: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshid/iris-flower-dataset?resource=download&select=IRIS.csv
