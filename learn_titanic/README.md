- This is my first ever "real" machine learning project where I performed Exploratory Data Analysis on the Titanic Dataset from Kaggle. I then imported a Logistic Regression model from sklearn 
to create a simple model that predicts whether or not passengers would survive given relevant features about them.
- Although it is my first step into machine learning, I learned a lot of basic building blocks in observing and filtering data which I was able to translate into other more advanced ML projects.
- I followed Divya Amaranath's guide on Medium, which the link to the guide is here: https://medium.com/@divyaamaranath7/your-first-data-science-project-with-python-titanic-survival-prediction-62afe49219a1
- The dataset I used on Kaggle is in this link: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data?select=train.csv
